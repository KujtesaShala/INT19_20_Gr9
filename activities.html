            It is located in front of the Palace of Youth and Sports.It was unveiled on 17 February 2008,<br> the day that Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia.
            The monument consists of the English-language word "Newborn" in capital block letters,<br> which were painted bright yellow when the sculpture was first revealed.
            The monument was later re-painted with the flags of the states that have recognized Kosovo.<br>
            At the unveiling of the monument it was announced that it will be painted differently on the anniversary of Kosovo's independence movement day every year.<br>
            The monument attracted the attention of international media reporting Kosovo's movement declaration of independence, and it was featured prominently on the front page of The New York Times.

            Pristina’s public library building was completed in 1986.Covered in a lattice of fence-like metal,<br>
            the building’s windows are obstructed, giving views from within the library a captive essence.
            Designed in the brutalist style, in many ways the library seems to look toward the future. <br>
            Yet the white domes that top the many sections of the library were built to resemble men’s hats <br>
            of the national outfit, putting the library in the middle of a conflict between tradition and modernity.<br>
            This building it is certainly a unique architectural effort and captures the spirit of a country recently ravaged by war and working to move forward and rebuild.<br>
            Inside, there are more than 2 million library items, including rare materials such as books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps and photographs.<br>
            There are two reading rooms, an amphitheater and a meeting hall. It has been used by Croatian and Bosnian refugees as living quarters and by the Serbian Army as a command center,<br>
            during which many historical books were destroyed. The library is open for all.

            While Kosovo is predominantly Muslim with a Serbian Orthodox minority, one of the most important religious sites in the city is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa.<br>
            While she was born in modern-day North Macedonia, she is ethnically Albanian and therefore extremely important to the people of Kosovo. <br>
            The cathedral was inaugurated in 2010 on the hundredth anniversary of her birth.

            The Museum of Kosovo is the main museum of Pristina, located inside a gorgeous building built in 1889<br>
            (judging by the Austro-Hungarian style of construction). It opened as a museum in 2014. In its rooms you can admire unique pieces of art of various eras,<br>
            such as Dardanian, Romanian and Illyrian. The museum, which is divided into three large departments, 
            has a beautiful collection of archaeological pieces that were found in the surrounding <br>
            Pristina area and the rest of the country. The museum is worth a visit, not just for its materials,
            but also because it is one of the most beautiful and majestic buildings in the capital city.

                The Kosovo National Theater is among the first cultural institutions to be founded in Kosovo after the Second World War.<br>
                Initiated by a Prizren amateur ensemble in 1946, it quickly moved to Kosovo’s capital Pristina in what was then the newly built culture center. <br>
                The theatre scene developed rapidly during the ‘70s and ‘80s for two reasons: the return of young generations upon studying in Yugoslav centers and the opening of<br>
                the Acting Department at the Shkolla e Lartë Pedagogjike [High Pedagogical School] in Pristina.
                Apart from theatre production, the ground floor of the building was used as an exhibition<br> and gathering space called Klubi i Artistëve [Artists’ Club].
                As with any other relevant institution at the time,<br> its status changed frequently depending on the political climate. In 1999, it became the Kosovo National Theatre.

             The lights are up, the Christmas trees are lit and the playlists with holiday music is on in Prishtina. What is also very popular during this time of the year is the seasonal holiday market Vere n’Dimen, <br>
a relatively new practice for Prishtina, but it is getting bigger every year.
This year, in one end of the square, you can find the little wooden houses which are filled with many artisanal products<br> (food, clothe, sculpture, home décor etc). There is definitely something there that will make for a great souvenir or a Christmas gift.<br>
After this you can walk to the other end of the square where another interesting spot will be waiting for you; anyhow, on the way there you can enjoy all the bright festive lights.<br>

Now at this end you can see that there’s also little wooden houses lined up on both sides, and that is the place where<br> I usually stop at one of the houses and order a nice warm mulled wine (or tea, or a snack). There is usually music on, and also from time to time <br>there are bands performing live. To me the social vibe in Vere n’Dimen speaks volumes about the holiday spirit in Prishtina.
