        <h2>About Prishtina</h2>
<pre class="pre1">    Prishtina is the capital and largest city of Kosovo with over 400.000 inhabitants, making it the administrative center. 
   The majority of the population is ethnic Albanian. The minorities comprise of Serb, Turk, and Roman ethnicity.
   here are old and ancient ruins left for the new generation – one that has had to adapt and grow quickly as the world is
    reaching the next leap towards the outer general transformation.
    The city has grown in population and size after the war. It is now a very dynamic city with head-spinning offers 
    and life exasperating from all sides. The city has changed a lot during the years,
    although there are constant trials of keeping the vibes – and the vibes do stand groovy. 
    Yet, there is constant noise and life splurging at your face in every corner.
    It has become a modern city, but without a river! Prishtina used to have a nice river flowing right through the middle of the city.
    But now, it is covered in cement and only flows out in the suburbs towards the north and south.
    The water supply comes from two main reservoirs of Badovci and Batllava, 
    two nice artificial lakes surrounded by lush nature making it a very nice spot for a casual picnic!</pre>
